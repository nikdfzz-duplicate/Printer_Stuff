This is an alternate handwheel that might work on any 8mm leadscrew.

There are two basic options, metal hub or printed.  The additional option is a handwheel without the knob.

For the metal hub the only source I have found is Openbuilds and can be found at this affiliate link: <BR>

The printed hub appears to work just fine for a fraction of the cost though.

Hardware required:

(2) M3 heatsets (1 is optional for the handwheel knob)<BR>
(1) M3x30 SHCS for the handwheel knob<BR>
(5) M3x10 BHCS to attach the handwheel to the hub<BR>
(1) M3x16 SHCS for the printed hub clamp<BR>

For the install tool:<BR>
(1) M5x40 SHCS<BR>
(1) M5 hex nut<BR>
(1) M5 washer<BR>

Install tool clamps the handwheel and printed hub together with the M5 bolt through the center.
